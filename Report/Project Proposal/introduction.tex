\section{Introduction}

California's diverse landscapes, ranging from dense forests to sprawling urban areas, have been increasingly threatened by wildfires. These devastating events not only pose a risk to human life and property but also have profound ecological impacts, making the study of their causative factors an urgent concern. The susceptibility of areas to wildfires is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including but not limited to vegetation types, weather patterns, agricultural practices, and economic conditions. Gaining a deeper understanding of how these elements interact is key to coming up with plans to reduce the risk of wildfires and safeguard communities at risk. This project aims to analyze the factors that make certain areas in California more prone to wildfires than others.
